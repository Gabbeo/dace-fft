# Introduction
This repository contains the retricted Python code for my Stockham FFT implementation created for my Master's thesis.
The code is used with the DaCe programming environment [LINK](https://github.com/spcl/dace) by loading them from the web interface started using DaCe's DIODE.
Each of the .py-files compiles to an SDFG using DaCe that can be modified with DIODE.

# Notes
The benchmark code is not working and is only provided as a reference if someone wants to study how the performance of the implementation was measured.
